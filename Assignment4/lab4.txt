Laboratory: Installing a small change to a big package

1. Used wget to obtain the tarball. I then extracted and filtered the tarball
   through xz and archived the files. I then had to obtain the gpg keyring 
   and the signature also using wget so that I could verify them. 
   (I made a separate directory called A4Install that I put all of these 
   inside of)

   commands:
   mkdir A4Install
   cd A4Install
   wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
   tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
   wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
   wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
   gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

   output:
   gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
   gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
   gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
   gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
   gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
   gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
   Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

   This occurred because the key used to sign and verify was a public key 
   so it cannot be verified as being trusted and as belonging to an owner.

2. I changed into the coreutils-8.29 directory and ran pwd to find out 
   what I was currently to later change the prefix when running ./configure.
   I then added the appropriate prefix to the ./configure command because 
   I cannot make changes in /usr/local. Then ran the make and make install 
   commands.

   commands:
   cd coreutils-8.29
   pwd (outputs /u/eng/class/classdna/A4Install/coreutils-8.29)
   ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classdna/A4Install
   make
   make install 

3. I first created two test directories: the first is similar the one in 
   the spec sheet with foo and bar and a second one similar to the directory 
   in the email from Karl Berry. I also used a separate directory which 
   was my own called 35LAssignments and had the files 
   Assignment1, Assignment2, Assignment3, and Assignment 4 in it.

   commands to make directories: (both start in home directory)
   directory 1:
   mkdir test
   cd test 
   touch foo 
   touch bar 
   
   directory 2: 
   mkdir test2

   commands to test directories:
   in test:
   /usr/bin/ls -aA
   output:
   .  ..  bar  foo

   in test2: 
   /usr/bin/ls -aA
   output:
   .  ..

   in 35LAssignments:
   /usr/bin/ls -aA
   output:
   .  ..  Assignment1  Assignment2  Assignment3  Assignment4

   As the bug report log recounts, the . and .. are included even though
   the -A is supposed to override the -a and therefore not include the 
   current or parent directory aliases (. , ..) This happens for all 
   three of them and indicates that the bug does indeed occur.

4. I first copied all of the contents of the patch into a file called 
   ls_patch and then applied the patch while still in the coreutils-8.29 
   directory.

   commands:
   touch ls_patch
   emacs ls_patch
   patch -p1 < ls_patch

   errors:
   patching file NEWS
   Hunk #1 FAILED at 4.
   1 out of 1 hunk FAILED -- saving rejects to file NEWS.rej
   patching file src/ls.c
   Hunk #1 succeeded at 1900 (offset -3 lines).
   patching file tests/local.mk
   patching file tests/ls/a-option.sh

5. I ran the command make to compile the changes made with the patch 
   but recieved the following error:
   
   WARNING: 'automake-1.15' is missing on your system.
         You should only need it if you modified 'Makefile.am' or
         'configure.ac' or m4 files included by 'configure.ac'.
         The 'automake' program is part of the GNU Automake package:
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake>
         It also requires GNU Autoconf, GNU m4 and Perl in order to run:
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
         <http://www.perl.org/>
   make: *** [Makefile:5997: Makefile.in] Error 127

   I then ran the command autoreconf -f -i to fix this error and then ran 
   the make command again which worked fine the second time around.

   commands:
   make
   autoreconf -f -i 
   make

6. I ran the tests this time on the same 3 directorires I used in number 3.
   I also made sure to check that if I used /usr/bin/ls I would get the 
   same output and I did as expected in all the directories.

   commands to see if patch worked:
   in test:
   command:
   ../A4Testing/bin/ls -aA
   output:
   bar  foo

   in test2:
   command:
   ../A4Testing/bin/ls -aA 
   output: (nothing)

   in 35LAssignments:
   command:
   ../A4Testing/bin/ls -aA
   output:
   Assignment1  Assignment2  Assignment3  Assignment4

   
   all commands:
   cd test
   ../A4Testing/bin/ls -aA
   cd ../test2
   ../A4Testing/bin/ls -aA
   cd ../35LAssignments
   ../A4Testing/bin/ls -aA
