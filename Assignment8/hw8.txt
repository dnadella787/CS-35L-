Assignment 8 
TA: Daniel Meirovitch

HW: 

1. Started a file called hw8.txt

2. 
Recloned the git library and then made a branch from v3.0 called quote.

commands:
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutilsHW 
cd diffutilsHW
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

3. 
Applied the appropriate patch as desired.

command: 
patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt 

output:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4.
Learned how to use emacs function.

5. 
commands and keystrokes:
emacs
C-x 4 a 
copied the appropriate part from git-log.txt but removed all the
parts that weren't changed by the patch i.e. all the files that are 
not the 6 files outputted in 3. I also changed the description
to meet the scenario.
    
    This is in response to the customer wanting to use ` only as a 
    spacing accent and not a quoting character meaning output should 
    look 'like this' or "like this", instead of `like this' or 
    ``like this'' but desires a very minimal patch. 
    * src/cmp.c, src/diff.c:
    * src/diff3.c, src/dir.c:
    * src/sdiff.c, src/util.c:
    Quote 'like this' or "like this" in commentary.
    * src/cmp.c (try_help, specify_ignore_initial, usage, main):
    * src/diff.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, specify_value)
    (compare_files):
    * src/diff3.c (main, try_help, option_help_msgid, usage)
    (read_diff):
    * src/dir.c (compare_names):
    * src/sdiff.c (try_help, usage, check_child_status, main):
    * src/util.c (finish_output):
    Quote 'like this' in output.

6. 
First added all the modified files to the staging area and then
ran git commit to commit all the files. I made the commit by adding 
-F flag to add the commit message using the ChangeLog file created
earlier.

commands:
git status (all red since theyve been changed by the patch)
git add src/*.c 
git status (all green now)
git commit -F ChangeLog 

output:

7. 
I ran the git format-patch command as instructed by the spec sheet. 

commands:
git format-patch -1 --stdout > ../formatted-patch.txt 

8.
Cloned another repository and called it diffutilsHW2. I created a new 
branch from this called patchery on v3.0. I then used git am to use the
formatted-patch.txt created in the last question. I then ran the 
appropriate commands to build it and also had to get the additional 
patch once more. There were some errors outputted but it was noted on 
piazza that these were ok. 

commands:
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutilsHW2
cd diffutilsHW2 
git checkout v3.0 -b patchery
git am ../formatted-patch.txt 
./bootstrap
cd ..
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring20/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
cd diffutilsHW2
patch -p0 < ../diffutils-gets.diff 
./configure
make
make check 

output:

9.
I ran the make distdir command and had no errors with it. I then 
viewed the diffutils*/ChangeLog and the first commit message was 
from me and was the one I wrote above. 

commands:
make distdir
cat diffutils-3.0.1-a81d/ChangeLog | less 

10.
I first ssh'd into lnxsrv10 using the -X flag for X11 forwarding.
I scrolled until I the last merge before 2015-01-25. My view 
of the mergepoint had the following information:

Author: Joakim Verona <joakim@verona.se> 2015-01-24 17:11:31
Committer: Joakim Verona <joakim@verona.se> 2015-01-24 17:11:31
parent: (long hash value) (Merge Branch 'master' into xwidget)
parent: (long hash value) ((find-function-regexp): Don't watch `defgroup')
child: (long hash value) (Merge branch 'master' into xwidget)
branches: master, remotes/origin/master and many more (266)
Follows: emacs-24.4
Precedes: emacs-25.0.90 

    merge master 

The roles the subwindows have:

Top Left: Visual representation of merges, branches, commits, etc 
and has basic info on what was merged what was comitted etc.

Top Middle: Name and email of person who did the action in top left 
window.

Top Right: Date of action shown in Top Left. 

Middle Area: Has SHAI ID, data on which row you are currently on, and  
a search feature.

Bottom Left: Has information on the action thats clicked on from the 
top left such as the persn who did it, the parent tree, general info 
on the changes, date, etc. Some also seem to have some diff outputs
that can be used as patches appended to the bottom.

Bottom Right: Has a navigation pane in which you can look at comments
and also the patches that were talked about in Bottom Left. Although
they are all in one window in bottom left, the bottom right window 
allows you to automatically go to one area in bottom left window. 

commands:
ssh -X lnxsrv10 
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L
gitk
