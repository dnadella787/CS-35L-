Assignment2: SSH setup and use in applications

Laboratory Log:


SSH-agent Portion:

I first logged into lnxsrv09 and had to make a directory called ".ssh." In this way lnxsrv09 is treated as the client while lnxsrv07 is treated as the server. I then ran ssh-keygen to
actually create my own ID saved as key and also a public key saved as key.pub.

**It is important to note the permissions on each of these files. key has permissions -rw------- indicating that only the owner has read and write permissions and everybody else has no
other permissions. key.pub has permissions -rw-r--r-- indicating that the owner has read and write priveledges but this time all other user also have read priveledges and nothing more.**

I then created a file called authorized_keys in the same .ssh directory. I then had to change the permissions on the file using chmod and proceeded to append the public key to
authorized_keys. The file authorized_keys holds the proper keys to log into another linux server.

To automate the process without having to enter the passphrase when logging into another server, we simply add the private key to ssh-agent using ssh-add. We then run the ssh command
using the specific key to SSH into the specific linux server.

I also included a second command that I had used to go from lnxsrv10 to lnxsrv07 to lnxsrv09 using the "dirty method" from the article on the spec sheet.

commands:

mkdir .ssh
ssh-keygen
touch authorized_keys
chmod g-r,o-r authorized_keys
cat key.pub >> authorized_keys
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add key
ssh -i key classdna@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu

ssh -A -t -i key classdna@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A -i key classdna@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu



Port Forwarding Portion:

I downloaded both Xming and Xming fonts from sourceforge and then configured my putty by simply checking off the X11 forwarding option. I then made sure it worked by running xeyes which
proceeded to create a small window with eyes following wherever my cursor was currently at on the screen. 

commands:
xeyes



Multihop Portion:

(Started in lnxsrv09 hopped to lnxsrv07 and then to lnxsrv10)
I first went into my .ssh directory and created a file called config in which I added the following lines.

Host lnxsrv07
     HostName lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu

Host lnxsrv10
     ProxyCommand ssh -q lnxsrv07 nc lnxsrv10.seas.ucla.edu 22

I then still had to add the private key to ssh-agent because otherwise when trying to access lnxsrv10 I would be prompted for a password for my seas account. In addition, if I wanted to
just access lnxsrv07 from lnxsrv09 I was able to just use the command "ssh lnxsrv07." The key in this portion that I added to ssh-agent is the same as the one added in the first part.

commands:
cd .ssh
touch config
emacs config (typed in lines above)
eval `ssh-agent`
ssh-add key
ssh lnxsrv10
